# Week1-Homework: Code Refactor

## OverView

This assignment was given after week 1 of the coding boot camp at Monash University. In this assignment we were given a mock site where we had to implement the things we learnt over the first week. The task given on this assignment was to evaluate the html and css, and try to implement sematic elements that weren't used or to consolidate the css file as much as I knew how too.

In this assignment some challenges that were faced was, that not all the text in the css could be consolidated for example the text below.

In trying to consolidate this text opening the code on the web caused 2 boxes to disappear. In doing this the conclusion that was came to was that it needed to be in 3 different text because he was creating 3 different boxes. There may be a code that can do this in a simpler manner but to my knowledge i could not find a way. 

## User Story

The user story given for this assignment was "AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines"

## Acceptance Criteria

The Acceptance criteria in this assignment were:

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Learning Achivements

What was learnt whilist completing this assignment were that some skills are needed to be polished. In doing this assignment a realization of needing to know what all semantic elements do, so they could be implemented the right way. Knowing codes for css would also be beneficial in being able to consolidate the css file further.
